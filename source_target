/* Write a SQL Query  to identify new id in source, target nad mismatched*/


/* Given Tables */

create table source(id int, name varchar(5))

create table target(id int, name varchar(5))

/* Insert Data into Team Table */

insert into source values(1,'A'),(2,'B'),(3,'C'),(4,'D')

insert into target values(1,'A'),(2,'B'),(4,'X'),(5,'F');


/* SQL Query Output */
SELECT coalesce(s.id,t.id) as id,

	WHEN s.name!=t.name THEN "Mismatched"
    WHEN s.name IS NULL THEN "New in Target"
    WHEN t.name IS NULL THEN "New in Source"

/* Query Result */
